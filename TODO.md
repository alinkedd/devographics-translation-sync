# TODO

It would be nice to:
- add checks and tests
- make this module loadable dynamically (?)
- make package scripts more advance (all files?)
- read files from github (?)
- add this to devographics repos (?)

## To fix
- leave original text line with 2 spaces inside intact without new line (state_of_html.yml - options.accessibility_techniques.fieldset_and_legend.description)
- adding initial offset spaces in block starting with empty line with no offset spaces (results.yml - custom_data.details)
- changing single quotes and double quotes to double quotes and escaped double quotes (results.yml - share.site.twitter_text)
